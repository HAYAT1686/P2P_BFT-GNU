# P2P_BFT-GNU
The primary objective  is to analyze the structure and behavior of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks under different conditions. We utilized two distinct datasets: the Gnutella dataset and a sample Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) dataset. The goal is to compare and understand the network properties, fault tolerance, and performance metrics of these networks.
FOR BFT , A EXAMPLE SAMPLE DATASET IS USED & GNUTELLA USES AN https://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella08.html DATASET .
GNUTELLA SET IS TRIED FOR "DEGREE DISTRIBUTION",
BFT DATASET FOR "Response Time Distribution","Correct Responses Distribution" &  "Proportion of Byzantine Node"
